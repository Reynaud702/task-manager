üåê API Documentation
Health Checks
All microservices provide health check endpoints:
GET http://localhost:5000/health
GET http://localhost:5001/health
GET http://localhost:5002/health
GET http://localhost:5003/health
Example API Calls
Authenticate User:
javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        username: 'user123',
        password: 'securepassword'
    })
})
Calculate Due Date Priority:
javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/calculate-due-date', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        due_date: '2024-12-15',
        current_priority: 'medium'
    })
})
Record Task Completion:
javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5003/api/stats/record-completion', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        task_id: 'task_123',

        task_title: 'Complete Project',
        category: 'CS361'
    })
})

üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles
Microservices Communication
HTTP REST APIs: All inter-service communication via HTTP requests
No Direct Imports: Services are completely decoupled
Process Isolation: Each service runs in its own process
Port-based Separation: Each service operates on a unique port
Data Flow
User interacts with the web interface
JavaScript makes HTTP requests to appropriate microservices
Microservices process requests independently
Results are returned and displayed in the UI
Statistics are automatically tracked and updated

üéØ Project Value
TaskPro demonstrates:
Microservices Architecture: Proper service decomposition and communication
Full-Stack Development: Frontend and backend integration
API Design: RESTful service interfaces
Process Management: Multiple service orchestration
User Experience: Intuitive task management interface
